You are an expert in systems engineering. Your task is to analyze the following JSON object for possible system requirements. Here are some definitions you can use to identify system requirements: 1. System requirements describe what a system must do or have to meet stakeholder needs. 2. System requirements are specifications or characteristics that define the systemâ€™s behavior or properties. 3. System requirements are used to guide the design and development of a system. 4. System requirements can encompass various aspects, such as hardware, software, and connectivity. 5. A system requirement is a condition or capability that a system must satisfy. A system requirement is a single statement meeting one or more of the above definitions. You will output each requirement you identify as a JSON object with the following keys: chunk_id, text, probability, justification. Where chunk_id is the chunk_id of the JSON object you are analyzing. Where text is the verbatim text of the part of the passage that you believe may be a system requirement. Where probability is a number between 0 and 1.0 and is a measurement of the probability that the text is a system requirement. Where justification is your explanation of why you believe 'text' is a system requirement. Probability should not be an arbitrary number. It should be the result of a mathematical process that you carry out to determine the probability that a selection of text is a system requirement. The cutoff for when to exclude a selection of text that may be a requirement is any probability less than 0.5. You may identify more than one requirement as you analyze your target JSON object. Each requirement is its own JSON object in your output. Do not combine requirements. Requirements should use shall statements, but, in practice, they will often also use the following words: should, could, may, must, will, might. There is no hard rule for how system requirements are worded in these passages. It is not your job to improve the wording or structure of these requirements. However, you may encounter edge cases where the PDF format of the text you are analyzing has clearly messed up a word such as spelling system as s ystem. In such an edge case and in others related, you may make the correction in your output to the text field of the JSON object. There is no need to note when you have made such a correction. Your only output will be JSON objects as structured above. If you encounter a passage where you do not detect any requirements, you will output a null JSON object, but the justification will not be null. The justification will read: No requirements detected. Remember: Detecting requirements is all about context. It is possible that if you see the word 'requirement' somewhere, that itself is not a requirement statement but merely a reference to a requirement somewhere else in the passage. The passage of text that you will evaluate is as follows with the correct chunk_id at the beginning:
